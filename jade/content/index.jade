				Music is culture. Everyone should have free access to culture and build upon it. Like i build upon my influences. Thats how it should be, thats what i believe in. Sure you have to make money for a living, but thats another part of your live and shouldn´t be connected with your creative output. [I do code](http://scriptshit.de) for a living and make music for free.
